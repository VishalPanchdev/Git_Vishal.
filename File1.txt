I love my India, I love my nation
Every dust is my God's creation
People, hill, and stones are divine
Rivers are silver and crops shrine

Forgive and be kind is the witness
Holy soul and sturdy body is a fitness
Yog, Viyog, And Sanyog is a lifestyle
Unlearn past and make the new smile

Righteousness is the plain living
The purity no misgiving no grieving
Balanced parity and coequality
Help to growability of mentality
